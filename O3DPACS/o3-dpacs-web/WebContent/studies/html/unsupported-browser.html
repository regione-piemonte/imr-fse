      <p>It looks like you may be using a web browser version that in not supported<br>
        Viewer works best in the newest and last prior version of these browsers: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.google.com/chrome" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.mozilla.com/firefox" target="_blank">Firefox</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/safari" target="_blank">Apple Safari</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/edge" target="_blank">Microsoft Edge</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Viewer works also with <a href="https://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/download-ie" target="_blank">Internet Explorer 11</a>
        but the performance can be lower.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Any browser you use needs to have JavaScript turned on.</p>

        <h3>You can't update your browser</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Ask your system administrator to update your browser if you cannot install updates yourself.</li>
          <li>If you can't change your browser because of compatibility issues, think about installing a second browser for utilization of this site and keep the old one for compatibility.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Troubleshoot browser errors</h3>
        <p>
          If you're using a browser that works with Viewer but see the "This browser is not supported" error, an extension might be causing the problem.
          Try turning off your browser extensions.
